# Superdatamosh

A small set of Ruby scripts written to work with the [aviglitch](https://github.com/ucnv/aviglitch) Rubygem. This code was borrowed from their example page.

**USAGE**

In order to run these scripts, you'll need the aviglitch Rubygem installed. You can download a fork from my GitHub [here](https://github.com/LambdaCalculus37/aviglitch), then run:

> gem install aviglitch

The README file for aviglitch has further usage details.

**TO DO**

1. Try and take file I/O params when you run the scripts; right now it's hardcoded to take a file named 'file.avi' and output 'output.avi'.

2. Anything else?
